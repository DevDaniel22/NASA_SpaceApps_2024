Step 1:
What do we want the model to predict?

Step 2:
Determine which datasets (out of the ones provided by the challenge) would best forecast what we are aiming to predict.

Step 3:
Decide which models (4) we want to use (LSTM seems like most accurate based on papers I've read)

Step 4:
Need a front end for the site that farmers can easily interact with

Step 5:
Link front end to model that makes predictions
